                    Deficit</h3>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Back in early 2024, I weighed 89 kg. I wasnâ€™t happy with how I felt physically and decided to commit
                    to
                    changing my lifestyle. I didn't opt for crash diets or expensive supplements â€” just consistent
                    calorie
                    deficit, walking, and strength training.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    A calorie deficit means you burn more calories than you consume. I used an app to track my daily
                    food intake,
                    aiming for around 1800â€“2000 kcal/day depending on activity. I ate plenty of protein, fiber-rich
                    foods, and
                    made sure I was getting enough water.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    I also walked 8,000â€“10,000 steps daily and worked out 3â€“4 times a week. I focused on compound lifts
                    and did
                    minimal cardio. The key was consistency and patience.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    After 4 months of sticking to this plan, I dropped from 89 kg to 72 kg. My energy levels increased,
                    my sleep
                    improved, and I felt a renewed sense of self-confidence.

                    My advice? Start small, be realistic, and track your progress. Donâ€™t chase fast results â€” aim for
                    sustainability.
