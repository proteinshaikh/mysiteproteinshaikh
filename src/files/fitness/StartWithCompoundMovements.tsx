        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-primary mb-4">🏋️‍♂️ Start with Compound Movements</h1>
        <p>Want to build strength fast? Hit compound movements! Squats, deadlifts, and bench presses work multiple muscles at once, delivering max gains in minimal time. I went from a 95-pound squat to 225 pounds in a year by focusing on these. Here’s why they’re awesome, how to crush them, and what I learned to keep it fun.</p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">🏁 Why Compounds Rule</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Train more muscles in less time.</li>
          <li><strong>Strength</strong>: Build real-world power for daily tasks.</li>
          <li><strong>Gains</strong>: Boost muscle growth with hormonal kicks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Compounds like squats transformed my body. They’re your shortcut to a stronger, fitter you, whether you’re a newbie or a pro.</p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">🔑 Key Principles to Nail Compounds</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Multi-Muscle Magic</strong>: Deadlifts hit back, glutes, and more for big strength gains.</li>
          <li><strong>Functional Power</strong>: Mimic real moves like lifting or pushing to stay injury-free.</li>
          <li><strong>Hormone Boost</strong>: Trigger growth hormones for faster muscle recovery.</li>
          <li><strong>Time-Saver</strong>: One squat beats hours of bicep curls.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalable</strong>: From bodyweight to barbells, compounds fit any level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These principles made my workouts epic. Squats and deadlifts built a foundation isolation exercises couldn’t touch.</p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">🚀 How to Crush Compound Lifts</h2>
        <p>Ready to lift? Here’s your game plan:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Master Form</strong>: Learn squat technique (hip depth, straight back). I used YouTube tutorials to start.</li>
          <li><strong>Pick Big Five</strong>: Focus on squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, pull-ups. I began with bodyweight squats.</li>
          <li><strong>Go Light</strong>: Start with an empty barbell. I added 5 pounds weekly to bench press.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan Workouts</strong>: Squats Monday, deadlifts Wednesday, bench Friday. Aim for 3–5 sets, 5–8 reps.</li>
          <li><strong>Level Up</strong>: Add 2.5–5 pounds every two weeks. My squat grew steadily this way.</li>
          <li><strong>Add Extras</strong>: Toss in lunges or curls after compounds for balance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These steps took my squat from 95 to 225 pounds in a year. Start small, and you’ll be lifting heavy in no time!</p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">⚠️ Challenges (and Fixes)</h2>
        <p>Compounds are tough but worth it. Here’s what I faced and how I won:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Form Struggles</strong>: My deadlifts were messy. <em>Fix</em>: Got a coach to tweak my stance.</li>
          <li><strong>Exhaustion</strong>: Squats drained me. <em>Fix</em>: Added rest days and 100g protein daily.</li>
          <li><strong>Gym Jitters</strong>: Barbells scared me. <em>Fix</em>: Practiced with dumbbells at home first.</li>
          <li><strong>Plateaus</strong>: Stalled at 185-pound squat. <em>Fix</em>: Dropped weight, upped reps to push through.</li>
          <li><strong>Injury Risk</strong>: Strained my back overdoing deadlifts. <em>Fix</em>: Prioritized form and rest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These hurdles taught me to stay sharp on technique and recovery, keeping compounds safe and effective.</p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">🧠 What I Learned</h2>
