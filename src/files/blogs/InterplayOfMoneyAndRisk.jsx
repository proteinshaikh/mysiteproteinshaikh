                <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">🧠 Society’s Perception of Money</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li>For many people, the ultimate goal is simply to <strong>acquire money</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>source of the money</strong> is often considered irrelevant, as long as it’s legal.
                    </li>
                    <li>Society tends to <strong>value the result</strong> more than the method used to achieve it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tax evasion</strong> is a crime, but <strong>tax avoidance</strong> through legal
                        loopholes is widely practiced and accepted.
                    </li>
                    <li>Smart financial planning means staying <strong>just inside the boundaries of legality</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">💡 The Nature of Spending and Investing</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li>Once you spend money, it's <strong>gone forever</strong>.</li>
                    <li>To make money grow, it needs to be <strong>invested, not just spent</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Wise investments are usually in <strong>essential goods or services</strong> that people use
                        every day.
                    </li>
                    <li>These types of investments offer more <strong>stability and consistency</strong> in returns.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">🚀 Unlimited Income: Job vs. Business</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li>A job offers <strong>predictable and secure income</strong>, but with limits.</li>
                    <li>Running or owning a business provides <strong>unlimited earning potential</strong>.</li>
                    <li>When a business becomes part of people's lives, its growth can be <strong>exponential</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>However, businesses come with <strong>significant risks</strong>: market changes, competition,
                        failure.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">⚖️ Stability vs. Risk</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Jobs</strong> offer a steady paycheck and lower risk—but limited wealth-building
                        potential.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you lose a job, <strong>getting another is usually possible</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Businesses</strong> are risky: market downturns, customer shifts, and operational
                        challenges can lead to failure.
                    </li>
                    <li>This risk is what differentiates a business from a job—and what creates opportunity for massive
                        gains.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">🏆 Risk and Reward</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Extraordinary success</strong> often follows those willing to take bold, calculated
                        risks.
                    </li>
                    <li>Business owners and investors who <strong>understand and manage risk</strong> can achieve great
                        wealth.
                    </li>
                    <li>While jobs are important for stability, they rarely provide <strong>transformational
                        wealth</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">📘 Final Thought</h2>
                <p>
                    Money and risk go hand in hand. To build lasting wealth, one must not only earn and spend wisely,
                    but also embrace smart investment and risk-taking. The path to financial freedom lies in
                    understanding the balance—and choosing boldly.
